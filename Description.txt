A simple Chrome extension that gives you the option to use the default HTML5 video player on YouTube.

Remember to go to chrome://extensions and check out the options page after you install.

If you have any problems or question please use the "Send Feedback" link in the "Details" tab.

- NOTE

* This does not replicate every YouTube feature. The default video player is bare bones and this is just an option for those who want it.

* Due to recent changes to YouTube only MP4 360p, MP4 720p and WebM 360p videos are available when using this extension.

* Some videos are protected and do not work with this extension (VEVO etc).
